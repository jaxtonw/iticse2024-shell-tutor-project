# Assignment 0 Hints

There are many ways to write this program.  Keep it simple.Â  I recommend that you restrict yourself the following variables, functions and methods:

* `chr()`
* `ord()`
* `int()`
* `len()`
* `open()`
* `close()`
* `print()`
* `str.islower()`
* `str.isupper()`
* `str.join()`


You will find many implementations of this program on the internet.  Before you give in to the temptation to turn in one of them as your own, here are some things to think about:

0. I can tell that you didn't write it.
1. Unlike high school, you're paying thousands of dollars to be here.  Cribbing code from the internet defeats the purpose of getting a university education and is, therefore, a waste of money.
2. Many instances of this program are written by internet show offs who want everybody to know how smart they are.  Unfortunately, I am much smarter than they and remain unimpressed.
3. Lots of jobs are being lost due to automation.  When your boss realizes that you can only write programs that happen to be online, you'll be replaced by a search engine.  Don't be a statistic.
4. Many implementations of this program are too clever for their own good and don't represent best practices (or even realistic practices).
5. Even if the code is modest and sensible, and even if it is presented in a helpful tutorial that taught you so much, you still didn't write it by yourself, did you?
6. If you can't figure out how to write a Caesar Cipher program without copying from the internet, what will you do when the next assignment isn't a typical introductory CS problem?
7. I can use Google, too.

If you *do* draw inspiration from a webpage, do the honorable thing and cite it in your `Plan.md`.  It will be much worse for you if you fail to do this.
